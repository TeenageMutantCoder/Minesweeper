# Minesweeper

This is just another one of my projects. This time, I made the popular game Minesweeper using pygame in Python 3. It is currently incomplete, and there are some bugs, but the game works. Hopefully I can improve it, give it an actual main menu with options, then create an executable that would allow non-programmers to install it.

## How to Use

### From Installer Executable

### From Zip File with Executable
Coming Soon

### From Source Code
First, download or clone the repository. Then, install the latest stable version of Python 3 and run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` after navigating to the root folder of the repository using Command Prompt or Terminal. Then, run the command `python minesweeper\game.py` if on Windows, or `python3 minesweeper/game.py` if on Mac or Linux (you can run the command `python -m minesweeper` or `python3 -m minesweeper` to run the full app, although this is discouraged at the moment because the main menu is really ugly).
