Minesweeper Game
Rules: A sqaure grid contains a number of hidden mines in random locations. 
       If you click on a mine, you lose.
       If you do not click on a mine, an open area of the grid will be cleared.
       A number will show on squares with mines around it that shows how many mines are directly around it.


Procedure:
    Main Menu:
        Option to start game
        Option to show leaderboard (top scores saved in database)
    If user presses show leaderboard button:
        Show database table sorted from top score to lowest score (shows position, score, name, size of grid used, difficulty used)
    If user presses start game button:
        Ask user for size of grid (a number between 5 and 30).
        Ask user for difficulty (determines number of mines. Easy is 20% of grid size. Medium is 30% of grid size. Hard is 40% of grid size).
        Start game:
            Draw grid using grid size chosen by user
            Draw Score (10 points per square correctly chosen, extra score on completion determined by difficulty (100, 300, or 500))
            Place mines at random locations
            If user presses mouse on a sqaure:
                If left click:
                    Check if square is a mine
                    If square is a mine:
                        End game
                        Show locations of mines (idk, make them red probably)
                        Print score
                        Allow user to save score to database (or not)
                    If sqaure is not a mine:
                        Change color of square (idk, maybe green)
                        Change color of surrounding area that also isnt a mine
                        Update score
                If right click:
                    Check if square is flagged
                    If square is flagged:
                        Unflag square (remove flag icon)
                    If square is not flagged:
                        Flag sqaure (add flag icon)
    
Implementation:
    Use tkinter for main menu
    Use pygame module for game

    Square class:
        is_mine: boolean value that determines if it is a mine
        is_flagged: boolean value that determines if it is flagged
